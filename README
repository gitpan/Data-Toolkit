Data::Toolkit
=============

This is a toolkit for manipulating attribute-value data.
It is useful in directory synchronisation systems and other data‚Äêpump applications.

Data is modelled as Entries which contain Attributes.
Each Attribute can contain zero or more Values.

Data::Toolkit provides support for mapping attribute names and values,
for avoiding duplicate values, and for sorting value sets.

Connectors are provided for CSV files, databases, and LDAP.

There is a discussion list which you can subscribe to:

Data::Toolkit is licenced on the same terms as Perl itself.

Installation
